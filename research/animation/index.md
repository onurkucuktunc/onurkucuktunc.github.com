<p><strong><em>Abstract - </em></strong>
Phenomenon of boiling is a challenging topic for computer graphics due to its
complex hydrodynamics and formulation. Realistic fluid animations require very
heavy three-dimensional fluid flow calculations, and surface estimations as
well. However, realism and performance are the two important objectives of the
boiling animation for a real-time application. We present an efficient method
for the simulation of boiling water in this paper. The method is based on
modeling the bubbles and waves as particles. Grid-based approach is used both
for the heating and the fluid surface. Our technique makes it possible to
produce the animation of boiling phenomena nearly in real-time.</p>
