title: "Diversity Search"
description: "We investigate the concepts of <strong>diversity</strong> and <strong>diverse nearest neighbor search</strong> in various fields and application areas with different types of data, such spatial, high-dimensional, and time-series data. Although the definition of diversity depends on the field, we propose techniques without neglecting the general objective of diversification, which is to maximize the similarity of search results to the query by minimizing pairwise similarities between the results."
